Desktop Skeleton - A qooxdoo Application Template using FontAwesome icon fonts
==============================================================================

!!!! WARNING !!!!

You have to use current qooxdoo master from github to have icon font support.

IT WILL NOT WORK WITH QOOXDOO RELEASESES BEFORE AND INCLUDING 5.0.2 

!!!! WARNING !!!!

This is a qooxdoo application skeleton which is used as a template. The 
'create-application.py' script (usually under tool/bin/create-application.py)
will use this and expand it into a self-contained qooxdoo application which 
can then be further extended. Please refer to the script and other documentation
for further information.

short:: is a standard qooxdoo GUI application
copy_file:: tool/data/generator/needs_generation.js source/script/custom.js

Please read the icon font documentation at
http://www.qooxdoo.org/5.1/pages/development/icon_fonts.html 
Especially about the need of having FontForge and its python package installed.


=== Modifying the generated application to use icon fonts ===

What was changed compared to the application generated by a bare 
./create-application.py iconfont call?

1) created the file fonts.json containing the make-font-map job definition
2) added the path of fonts.json in config.json into the "include" array
3) added the job "make-font-map" in the "export" array of config.json
4) added the FontAwesome font in the source/class/iconfont/theme/Font.js file
   in 2 sizes 16px and 32px
5) added the FontAwesome font files in the source/resource/iconfont/fonts directory
6) changed the button in the skeletop application at source/class/iconfont/Application.js
   to use an icon glyph instead of a png image and added a second button using a 32px red
   colored icon glyph
   
   
=== Compiling the application ===

1) run ./generate.py make-font-map
2) run ./generate.py source and/or ./generate.py build


=== Running the application ===

Open source/index.html or build/index.html in the browser, either directly as file or served by a web server
